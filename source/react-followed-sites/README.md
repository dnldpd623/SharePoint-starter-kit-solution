# Followed Sites webpart

This web part provides you the ability to display a list of site administrator defined number of sites that a given user is following, with paging as well as inline filtering of sites by keyword or phrase. Currently the list of followed sites includes classic as well as modern communication sites but does not include group enabled (modern) team sites.
