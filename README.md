## Objectives of this solution

SharePoint Communication Sites have great out-of-the-box capabilities, but the out-of-the-box capabilities may not always be sufficient for your scenarios. This is exactly why you are able to include your own customizations. This solution addresses common scenarios and tasks you may encounter when introducing those customizations, and provides examples and guidance on how you might address them including:

- Automated provisioning of simple demo content within a communication site
- Automated provisioning of the whole solution to any tenant within minutes
- Automated configuration of Site Scripts and Site Designs at the tenant level using the PnP Remote Provisioning engine
- Implementation of different customizations for SharePoint Online
- Usage of Office UI Fabric and reusable PnP SPFx controls within the customizations

## Pre-requirements

Here are current pre-requirements for making this solution work in your tenant.

- You will need to be a tenant administrator to be able to deploy this solution
    - Notice that you can get free developer tenant from [Office 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev-program), if needed.
- Automatic end-to-end provisioning only works with English tenants
    - All solutions and web parts are also English in the current implementation
- Release preferences for your tenant will need to be set as "Targeted release for everyone" option (also known as First Release)
- Add used tenant administrator account as Term Store Administrator in the Taxonomy Term Store 


## Getting started

The following steps will help you get started in any tenant as fast as possible:

- Ensure that you meet the [requirements for SharePoint Framework development](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-development-environment) and are using the latest version of [PnP PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-pnp/sharepoint-pnp-cmdlets?view=sharepoint-ps)
- Prepare your tenant, by accomplishing the tasks highlighted in document [Preparing your tenant for the PnP SharePoint Starter Kit](./documentation/tenant-settings.md).
- Upload and deploy the [`sharepoint-starter-kit.sppkg`](./package/sharepoint-starter-kit.sppkg) from the [`/package`](./package) folder to your tenant app catalog
    - After deploying the .sppkg package to the tenant app catalog, approve the requested API permissions. [Approving third party API access](./documentation/api-management.md).
- Use PnP PowerShell to connect to any site in your tenant with the [`Connect-PnPOnline` cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/sharepoint-pnp/connect-pnponline?view=sharepoint-ps)
- Move to the `provisioning` folder and execute the following command (using your own tenant url and the prefix of your choosing): `.\deploy.ps1 -TenantUrl https://contosodemosk.sharepoint.com -SitePrefix demo`
    - This will provision 3 site collections with urls of `/sites/demoportal`, `/sites/demohr`, and `/sites/demomarketing`. Your urls may vary depending on the SitePrefix you use.

> Notice that this script also adds tenant level settings like themes, site designs, taxonomy term sets, and other adjustments. Therefore, it is recommended to test the script in an isolated test tenant and not immediately execute it within your production environment. Nevertheless, a cleanup script will come shortly.
